# Win-Zoom

## Description

This script zooms in on the display to make everything appear a lot larger. The current script is set to zoom in twice, but can be modified to zoom in even further.
  - To restore the display back to the original settings, hold the `Windows` key down and keep pressing `-` until the display is back to normal.
  
This script also works from the user's lock screen!
